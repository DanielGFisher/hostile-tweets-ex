 - fetcher.py - MongoFetcher includes hardcoding
which is not flexible but due to time
limitations I didnt wish to stay on it for
a long period of time and as such I moved on

- manager.py - DataManager.load_and_process has duplications
of code and could be called unnecessary but I wanted to
make it a reusable class (More generic)
